# fooL

### How to do with it:
#### Preparations
You need a Python 3+ environment in your system.

In Linux, you can probably get Python 3 simply with
`apt install python3`
in Ubuntu, or another package manager, determined by your Linux distribution.

In Windows, you can download it from [the official website of Python][python.org].

After installation, you can check your Python version by typing `python` on the console.

#### Run the code
In bash or Windows cmd, type
`python foo.py`
to directly run the code. Then you can do anything as you wish.

You can also run the code with one or two parameter. Type
`python foo.py "找到女朋友"`
or
`python foo.py 2 "get a girlfriend"`
and see what happens.
